**ArtiGit** is a next-generation, fully decentralized Git infrastructure designed for privacy, censorship resistance, and high-performance collaboration. It leverages [Arti](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti) (Tor's Rust-based implementation) to ensure anonymous access to repositories while integrating multiple open-source technologies to build a robust, trustless, and self-sustaining ecosystem.

## 🌟 Features

ArtiGit aims to provide the following key features:

- **Privacy-Preserving Version Control**: Use Git without exposing your IP address or identity
- **Censorship-Resistant Repositories**: Access and share code even in restrictive environments
- **High-Performance Collaboration**: Built with Rust for optimal speed and efficiency
- **Decentralized Architecture**: No single point of failure or control
- **IPFS Integration**: Store large files efficiently using content-addressed storage (planned)
- **P2P Repository Mirroring**: Automatic mirroring using Radicle protocol (planned)
- **Distributed CI/CD**: Community-provided compute nodes for builds and tests (planned)

## 🏗️ Project Status

**Current Status**: Early Development

ArtiGit is currently in the early stages of development. We have implemented:

- ✅ Basic Git object model (ObjectId, ObjectType)
- ✅ Core repository functionality (init)
- ✅ File system object storage
- ✅ CLI interface framework

Still under development:
- 🚧 Transport layer implementation (HTTP, Tor)
- 🚧 Full Git command support (add, commit, clone, push, pull)
- 🚧 Arti integration for anonymous networking
- 🚧 IPFS, Radicle and other decentralized technology integrations

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version, 1.75.0 or newer recommended)
- Git

### Installation

Clone the repository and build the project:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Tejasdodla/arti-git.git
cd arti-git

# Build the project
cargo build

# Run ArtiGit
cargo run -- --help
```

### Basic Usage

Initialize a new Git repository:

```bash
cargo run -- init /path/to/repo
```

## 🧩 Architecture

ArtiGit is built on a modular architecture combining multiple decentralized technologies:

### Core Components

1. **Git Object Model**: Native implementation of Git's object storage and manipulation
2. **Repository Layer**: Manages local Git repositories, including working directory and references
3. **Transport Layer**: Handles communication with remote repositories (planned implementations for HTTP, SSH, and Tor)
4. **CLI Interface**: Command-line tools for interacting with repositories

### Integrations (Planned)

1. **Arti Integration**: Anonymous access to Git repositories over the Tor network
2. **IPFS Integration**: Decentralized storage for large files and binaries
3. **Radicle Integration**: Peer-to-peer repository mirroring and collaboration
4. **Gitea/Forgejo Integration**: Self-hosted Git repository management

## 📝 Development Roadmap

1. **Phase 1**: Complete Core Git Functionality
   - Implement remaining Git operations (add, commit, status)
   - Add networking commands (clone, push, pull)

2. **Phase 2**: Arti Integration
   - Create Tor transport layer
   - Add support for .onion repositories
   - Implement anonymous commit signing

3. **Phase 3**: Decentralized Extensions
   - IPFS integration for large file storage
   - Radicle integration for P2P mirroring
   - Gitea/Forgejo integration

4. **Phase 4**: Advanced Features
   - Distributed CI/CD system
   - Reputation and governance systems
   - Enhanced privacy features
