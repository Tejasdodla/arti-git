# Arti-Git Comprehensive Development Plan

## Project Overview

Arti-Git is a decentralized, privacy-focused Git implementation that integrates with Tor (via Arti) and IPFS for secure, anonymous, and distributed version control. This document outlines the comprehensive development roadmap for the project.

## Current Project Status (April 2025)

- **Version**: 0.1.0 (Early Development)
- **Core Components**: 
  - Git implementation via gitoxide (gix)
  - Tor transport layer via Arti
  - IPFS integration for object storage
  - Git LFS support
  - Command-line interface

**Note on Git Implementation:** The project leverages the `gitoxide` (`gix`) crates as dependencies for core Git functionality. This approach was confirmed as the most efficient and maintainable strategy, avoiding the need to clone the `gitoxide` repository and manually copy code. Future development will focus on integrating `gitoxide` APIs within the existing `arti-git` structure.
